# Functional Programming in TypeScript: Key Concepts and Examples

## Overview
Functional programming is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. This approach, inspired by languages like Haskell, can be applied in multi-paradigm languages like TypeScript.

### 1. Immutability and Pure Functions
- **Concept**: In functional programming, functions should be pure, meaning they don't cause side effects and their output is only determined by their input.
- **Benefits**: Easier testing, predictable behavior, and no side effects.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  interface Person {
    name: string;
    age?: number;
  }

  function getGreeting(person: Person) {
    return `Hello, ${person.name}, you are ${person.age} years old.`;
  }

  const isValidEmail = (email: string): boolean => /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(email);
  ```
  These functions are pure as they do not modify external state and produce consistent output for the same input.

### 2. Higher-Order Functions
- **Concept**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their result.
- **Benefits**: Enhanced modularity, reusability, and abstraction.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  const userArray: Person[] = [
    { name: "Janelle" },
    { name: "Rebecca" },
    { name: "Phil" },
  ];

  console.log(userArray.map((user) => user.name.toUpperCase()));
  ```
  The `map` function here is a higher-order function as it takes another function as its argument.

### 3. Composability
- **Concept**: The ability to combine simple functions to build more complex ones.
- **Benefits**: Code reusability and readability.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  userArray.map((item) => item.name).map((item) => item.toUpperCase());
  ```
  This demonstrates functional composition by chaining `map` functions.

### 4. Immutability
- **Concept**: Data objects should not be modified once created.
- **Benefits**: Easier to reason about, safer in concurrent environments, and helps avoid side effects.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  userArray.map(() => {});  // Creates a new array
  userArray.filter(() => {});  // Does not modify the original array
  userArray.reduce(() => {});
  
  userArray.sort(); // Mutates the original array
  userArray.slice(); // Creates a new array, doesn't mutate the original
  ```
  In these examples, methods like `map`, `filter`, and `slice` are immutable, while `sort` is mutable.

### Data Flow in Functional Programming
- Functional programming often emphasizes unidirectional data flow, where data is passed through a series of functions, each transforming it in some way without side effects.
- This approach can lead to more predictable and maintainable code, as the data transformations are clear and explicit.

### Conclusion
Applying functional programming principles in TypeScript can lead to code that is more predictable, testable, and easy to understand. By focusing on pure functions, higher-order functions, composability, and immutability, developers can write code that is robust and maintainable.
